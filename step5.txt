STEP 5: CUSTOMER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
=======================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
Build Step 5 of the Concrete Sales & Profit Analyzer to give users the ability to adjust customer pricing through intelligent categorization. This step will reference the differential between Goal Profit vs Projected Profit and enable users to create customer buckets based on Volume, Unit Price, and Profitability.

CORE REQUIREMENTS
==================

1. PROFIT DIFFERENTIAL DISPLAY
   - Show Goal Profit vs Projected Profit at page top
   - Visual indicator of gap/surplus with color coding
   - Percentage difference calculation
   - Clear call-to-action to close the gap

2. CUSTOMER CATEGORIZATION SYSTEM
   - Create buckets characterized by:
     * Volume purchased (total cubic yards)
     * Unit sale price (average $/yard)
     * Customer profitability (profit margin %)
   - Dynamic bucket creation with custom criteria ranges
   - Exclusive assignment (one customer per bucket)
   - Real-time conflict detection and resolution

3. BUSINESS LOGIC CONSTRAINTS
   - Customers can only be in one bucket at a time
   - Overlap detection for customers meeting multiple bucket criteria
   - Progress tracking showing % of customer base categorized
   - Bulk assignment option for uncategorized customers

4. PRICING ADJUSTMENTS
   - Apply price adjustments to customer buckets
   - Calculate revenue impact of pricing changes
   - Project new profit levels with adjustments
   - Validate goal achievement potential
