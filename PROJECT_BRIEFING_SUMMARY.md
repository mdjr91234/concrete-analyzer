## Technical Architecture Summary

### Technology Stack
```yaml
Frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript, Material-UI components
Backend: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL database, Redis caching
Analytics: Python-based ML services for forecasting
Infrastructure: Containerized deployment (Docker + Kubernetes)
```

### Microservices Architecture
1. **Authentication Service**: JWT-based with role-based access control
2. **Sales Management Service**: CRUD operations with real-time profit calculations
3. **Cost Management Service**: Cost tracking and manufacturing cost baselines
4. **Analytics Service**: Python/ML for forecasting and business intelligence
5. **Reporting Service**: PDF/Excel generation with scheduling

### Database Design
- **Core Tables**: users, sales, costs, concrete_types, projects, customers
- **Performance**: Optimized indexes for 10K+ sales records
- **Industry-Specific**: $70/yard manufacturing baseline, concrete delivery workflows
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for financial data modifications

## Business Logic Specifications

### Cost Structure (Mixed Cost Basis - Updated 2025-08-10)
- **Manufacturing Costs**: Per-yard basis ($70/yard baseline) - 70% of total cost
- **Labor Costs**: Lump sum basis (total amount for selected period) - 18% of total cost
- **Fixed Costs**: Lump sum basis (total amount for selected period) - 1% of total cost
- **Equipment**: 7.5% of total cost  
- **Fuel**: 3.5% of total cost

**Key Change**: Manufacturing costs remain per-yard for pricing calculations, while labor and fixed costs are now planned as lump sums to align with actual business budgeting practices.

### Key Metrics & Targets
- **Profit Margin Target**: 25% benchmark
- **Response Time**: <500ms for analytics queries
- **System Uptime**: 99.5% availability
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ concurrent users
- **Data Accuracy**: 99.9% calculation precision

## Security Architecture

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin**: Full system access (*)
- **Manager**: Sales/costs read/write/delete, reports, user management
- **Sales**: Sales read/write, costs read, reports read
- **Analyst**: Sales read, costs read, reports read/write

### Security Measures
- **Authentication**: JWT with 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for transit
- **API Protection**: Rate limiting, CSRF protection, input validation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all data modifications

## Critical User Feedback Resolved

### Original Issues (Fixed)
1. **Historical Analysis**: Monthly data now displays side-by-side with proper totals
2. **Workflow Logic**: Fixed premature goal setting - users now see data first
3. **Cost Projections**: Clear "Previous Period" vs "Future Period" columns
4. **Interface Size**: Compressed modules for better screen utilization
5. **Business Logic**: Changed to total profit goals (not per-yard)

### Validated Preferences
- **Two-column comparison layouts** strongly preferred over consolidated tables
- **Progressive disclosure** prevents cognitive overload
- **Focused summaries** preferred over detailed breakdowns
- **Mobile-responsive design** critical for field operations

## Implementation Readiness

### Immediate Development Priorities
1. **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL with concrete industry schema
2. **Authentication System**: JWT with role-based permissions
3. **Core API**: Sales and cost management endpoints
4. **Manufacturing Cost Engine**: $70/yard baseline calculations
5. **Two-Column UI Components**: Historical vs projected cost comparison

### Performance & Scalability Considerations
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer (Redis, application-level, database views)
- **Async Processing**: Background profit calculations and report generation
- **Database Optimization**: Connection pooling, read replicas, partitioning
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for dashboard updates

### Security Implementation Priority
1. **Week 1**: API security middleware, input validation, basic monitoring
2. **Week 2-3**: Advanced audit logging, anomaly detection, incident response
3. **Month 2-3**: Advanced threat protection, compliance automation
